Things to do, in sparse order:



- fix compilation errors (I get at least 20), even it works ignoring them (a
couple of files are creating most of them)

- show the events on the map

- scheduler.txt: what is it for? a default file if you don't provide another?

- open gui first to allow input params and map selection, then show progress
(gui off) or map (gui on)

- add small legend explaining nodes and map colors

- map not fixed to 1000 and take care of visualization in smaller screens

- some node crosses buildings near their destination (if we color as hospital
would make more sense, otherwise it could be seen as error)

- firefighters carrying victims should not overlap or they are not visible

- they go straight to victims. they should explore squares as a team.

- overlayCache problem in PotentialFieldRepository

- document getPlan

- strange use of Queue. First use add (generates exceptions), then get x with
peek and y with poll. Means read x, then read y and remove xy? Better to
document it.

- why you use [y][x] instead of viceversa?

- not sure about this syntax:
return overlayCache.getPlan(new int[] { xDest, yDest })[yPos][xPos] + obstacles[yPos][xPos];

- FileOutput forces #time;agent;x;y;z;velocity;options\n as first line when
given an output. Should we let it done elsewhere, keeping the class generic?

- heap space exception happened with ram<4GB.

- proximity with radius rather than rectangle?

- FR starting from map border

- Rtree extends but does not get smaller again if node number decreases
